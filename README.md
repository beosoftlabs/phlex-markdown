# `phlex-markdown`

`Phlex::Markdown` is a [Phlex](https://phlex.fun) view that renders Markdown into HTML using Phlex. You could use it directly â€” it takes a String of markdown and renders it to safe HTML.

Alternatively, you can define a sub-class and override various methods to customise the output.

For example, here we override `h1` and `ul`, adding some Tailwind classes to them.

```ruby
class MyMarkdown < Phlex::Markdown
  def h1 = super(class: "font-bold text-xl")
  def ul = super(class: "ml-4 pt-2")
end
```

When we render the view.

```ruby
content = <<~MD
  # Hello World

  - A
  - B
  - C
MD

output = MyMarkdown.new(content).call
```

The `output` will use the attributes from our methods.

```html
<h1 class="font-bold text-xl">Hello World</h1>
<ul class="ml-4 pt-2">
  <li>A</li>
  <li>B</li>
  <li>C</li>
</ul>
```

You could also wrap the whole document in an `<article>` element by overriding `template`.

```ruby
class MyMarkdownArticle < Phlex::Markdown
  def template
    article(class: "prose") { super }
  end
end
```
