# `phlex-markdown`

`Phlex::Markdown` is a [Phlex](https://phlex.fun) view that renders Markdown into HTML using Phlex. That means, you can define a class that inherits from `Phlex::Markdown` and override various methods to customise the output.

For example, here we override `h1` and `ul`, adding some Tailwind classes.

```ruby
class MyMarkdown < Phlex::Markdown
  def h1 = super(class: "font-bold text-xl")
  def ul = super(class: "ml-4 pt-2")
end
```

When can render this view with some Markdown.

```ruby
content = <<~MD
  # Hello World

  - A
  - B
  - C
MD

output = MyMarkdown.new(content).call
```

And `output` will be

```html
<h1 class="font-bold text-xl">Hello World</h1>
<ul class="ml-4 pt-2">
  <li>A</li>
  <li>B</li>
  <li>C</li>
</ul>
```
